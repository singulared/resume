Hi! I am an experienced **team lead**, **software engineer** and **open-source enthusiast** with an interest in **Rust**, **Python**, **distributed systems** and cryptography.

I am interested in the next technology stack:

- Rust (Tokio, Actix, Tonic, Diesel)
- Python (Asyncio, Aiohttp, FastAPI, Pydantic, MyPy)
- Databases (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Cassandra)
- Distributed systems (CRDT, Raft)

I have quite a good experience in leading backend engineering mostly in **[Rambler]**. The main responsibilities in this position were: 

- Technical and architecture decisions with priority in code quality and maintainability
- People management: interviews, onboarding, 1to1, mentoring, review
- interaction with business: meetings, planning, discussing business decisions, discussing workflow

Btw I started some open source projects like **[Hitbox]**. It is a high-performance caching framework for Rust applications and caching reverse proxy daemon.

In addition, I am an information security analyst and cryptographer as part of my university specialization.

As a hobby, I really like **embedded development** and working with some Linux-based devices such as PinePhone, PineTime etc.
